This app is meant to fill the gap between the share menu and the destination of
the link/imagefile/videofile/audiofile you want to share.

I noticed that it is impossible in some apps to copy the link to content i 
want to share. So i started to work on this Tool.

It lets you choose "ShareToClipboard" from most apps and copies the URL to the
content to the clipboard.
It also lets you manage the history of links you shared with this app in case 
you want to share it or copy it to the clipboard again.
Currently it only supports the "text" type of sharing, but in the future 
more MIME types will be supported.
